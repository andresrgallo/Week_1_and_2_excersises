# Use interpolation to show the result of 99*99 (e.g: 99x99=...)

# Ask the user for their year of birth and use it to say:
# "Your age is..."

# Use code to work out how many 3s are in 9
# display the result on screen

# Use code to work out the _remainder_ of 10/3
# display the result on screen



# Code below, commenting it out as progress done 

# puts "the result of 99 times 99 is #{99*99}"

# puts "What is your year of birth?"
# year = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Your age is #{Time.new.year.to_i - year}"

# num = 9
# answer = 9/3
# puts "There are #{answer} threes in #{num}"

# remaind = 10%3
# puts "the remainder of 10/3 is #{remaind}"
